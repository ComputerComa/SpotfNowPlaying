# üéß Spotify : Current Track 

![NodeJS and Spotify Logo](https://image.prntscr.com/image/FHtaiEkPTjalgfKIupVZWg.png)

##### What does it do
Automatically fetches "currently playing track" information from user's Spotify Account and writes it into a plain *.txt file. Also outputs it to console. In addition it has the ability to send the info to a discord webhook. 

#####  How does it work
It utilizes Spotify's [`Web API`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and specifically the endpoint for current track informations `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing`. The user's `refresh_token` is used to make continuous requests on behalf of the authorized user. After a one-time authorization process the `refresh_token` is kept locally ‚ö†Ô∏è so please use at your own risk ‚ö†Ô∏è. 


##### What do you need

 - NodeJS & NPM
 - CLIENT_ID & CLIENT_SECRET from the [Spotify Developer Console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)
 - a discord webhook if you plan to use them
